My research seeks to integrate financial tools into natural resource conservation. Leveraging private capital can lead to improved ecological conditions, better economic livelihoods, and greater community resilience. I focus primarily in marine environments and communities, but my research builds on, and potentially expands, science in other natural resources like agriculture and forestry. Improvements through financial innovation are driven by two avenues. First, private finance closes the “conservation funding gap”. Managers and resource users are often budget constrained and don’t have the necessary initial capital to make changes. Check out my projects on impact investing in fishery quota markets to learn more.\r\n            Second, financial tools ellicit behavior change. If structured correctly, they may be able to incentivize positive behavior change for resource conservation.
